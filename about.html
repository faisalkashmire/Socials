    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our space — where creativity meets curiosity, and passion drives purpose.

My name is Faisal, a 19-year-old B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student from SSM College of Engineering. I'm not just studying technology — I'm living it, exploring it, and using it to shape a better, more expressive digital world.

But beyond code and algorithms, I’m deeply rooted in the world of mobile and DSLR photography. With over 5 years of hands-on experience in Adobe Lightroom, I specialize in transforming raw moments into powerful visuals. Whether it's nature, street, portraits, or product photography, my lens tells a story — edited to perfection with color, depth, and life.

This page isn’t just about me; it’s about the journey I’m building — one frame, one project, one line of code at a time.

If you’re someone who values creativity, clean aesthetics, and a fresh perspective, you’ll feel right at home here.

Let’s create something meaningful together.
